# Kill Team 2024 Weapon Rules

Weapon rules apply whenever a friendly operative uses a weapon that has them. Common weapon rules can be found below, and you may find rare weapon rules in your kill team's rules.

**General Rules:**
- Weapons gain no benefit from having the same weapon rule more than once, unless the weapon rule has an **x**, in which case select which x to use.
- If a friendly operative is using a weapon that has multiple weapon rules that would take effect at the same time, you can choose the order they take effect.

## Weapon Rules

### Accurate X
You can retain up to **x** attack dice as normal successes without rolling them.

**Special case:** If a weapon has more than one instance of Accurate x, you can treat it as one instance of **Accurate 2** instead (this takes precedence over x rules above).

---

### Balanced
You can re-roll **one** of your attack dice.

---

### Brutal
Your opponent can **only block with critical successes**.

---

### Ceaseless
You can re-roll any of your attack dice results of **one result** (e.g., results of 2).

---

### Devastating X
Each retained critical success **immediately inflicts x damage** on the operative this weapon is being used against, e.g., Devastating 3.

**Area effect:** If the rule starts with a distance (e.g., 1" Devastating x), inflict x damage on that operative and each other operative visible to and within that distance of it.

**Important:** The success isn't discarded after doing so—it can still be resolved later in the sequence.

---

### Heavy
An operative **cannot use this weapon** in an activation or counteraction in which it moved, and it **cannot move** in an activation or counteraction in which it used this weapon.

**Conditional Heavy:** If the rule is **Heavy (x only)**, where x is a move action, only that move is allowed, e.g., Heavy (Dash only).

**Note:** This weapon rule has no effect on preventing the Guard action.

---

### Lethal X+
Your successes equal to or greater than **x** are **critical successes**, e.g., Lethal 5+.

---

### Piercing X
The defender collects **x less defence dice**, e.g., Piercing 1.

**Conditional Piercing:** If the rule is **Piercing Crits x**, this only comes into effect if you retain any critical successes.

---

### Punishing
If you retain any critical successes, you can retain **one of your fails as a normal success** instead of discarding it.

---

### Relentless
You can re-roll **any** of your attack dice.

---

### Rending
If you retain any critical successes, you can retain **one of your normal successes as a critical success** instead.

---

### Saturate
The defender **cannot retain cover saves**.

---

### Severe
If you **don't retain any critical successes**, you can change **one of your normal successes to a critical success**.

**Important:** The Devastating and Piercing Crits weapon rules still take effect, but Punishing and Rending don't.

---

### Shock
The first time you strike with a critical success in each sequence, also **discard one of your opponent's unresolved normal successes** (or a critical success if there are none).
