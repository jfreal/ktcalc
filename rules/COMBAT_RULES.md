# Kill Team 2024 Combat Rules

## Defense Mechanics

### Defense Dice
**All operatives roll exactly 3 defense dice.**

This is a **fixed value** in Kill Team 2024 and cannot be modified by abilities or equipment, with one exception:

**Exception - Piercing X:**
- Piercing 1: Defender rolls 2 defense dice
- Piercing 2: Defender rolls 1 defense die
- Piercing 3: Defender rolls 0 defense dice (no save possible)

### Save Characteristic
Each operative has a Save value (e.g., 3+, 4+, 5+):
- **Normal success**: Die roll ≥ Save value
- **Critical success**: Die roll of 6
- **Fail**: Die roll < Save value

### Cover Saves
Operatives in cover can retain **automatic saves** without rolling:
- Cover provides "auto-successes" retained before rolling defense dice
- These are retained as normal successes (not critical)
- Piercing can reduce the number of available cover saves

## Attack Sequence Overview

1. **Attacker rolls attack dice**
   - Number based on weapon profile
   - Modified by weapon rules (Balanced, Relentless, etc.)

2. **Attacker retains successes**
   - Normal successes and critical successes
   - Modified by weapon rules (Accurate, Lethal, Rending, Severe, etc.)

3. **Defender rolls defense dice (always 3)**
   - Modified by attacker's Piercing
   - Modified by cover saves

4. **Defender retains successes**
   - Normal successes and critical successes

5. **Cancel hits with saves**
   - Critical saves cancel any hit 1:1
   - Normal saves cancel normal hits 1:1
   - Normal saves cancel critical hits 2:1

6. **Resolve damage**
   - Remaining hits deal damage
   - Devastating damage occurs regardless of saves

## Key Principles

1. **Defense dice are always 3** (unless reduced by Piercing)
2. **No invulnerable saves** exist in KT2024
3. **Cover provides auto-successes**, not additional dice
4. **Piercing is the only way** to reduce defense dice below 3
