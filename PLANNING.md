# Planning

## Development Workflow

When developing new features:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Add entry describing the new feature or fix
2. **Update README.md** - If the feature is user-facing, update the README with:
   - New features in the features list
   - Any new usage instructions
   - Updated screenshots if UI changed significantly
3. **Test thoroughly** - Verify calculations and UI work correctly

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Add more weapon ability combinations
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add Fight calculator comparison matrix

## Feature Ideas

- Export results to image/PDF
- Save/load configurations locally
- Batch comparison of multiple weapons

## Notes

- Keep changelog entries concise but descriptive
- Group related changes under the same date/title
- Test URL sharing after any state changes
