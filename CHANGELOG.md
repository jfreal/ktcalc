# Changelog

## December 2025 - UI Improvements

- Limited Accurate to max of 3 (matching game rules)
- Limited Cover Saves (normal and crit) to max of 3 (matching defense dice count)
- Kill chance tables now truncate when all scenarios reach 0%, showing summary row for remaining wounds
- Added GitHub link footer with open source contribution message

## December 2025 - CeaselessPlusBalanced & Severe Rule Fixes

- Added CeaselessPlusBalanced: combined reroll that applies Ceaseless first, then Balanced on an unrerolled fail
- Fixed: Balanced can only target fails that weren't rerolled by Ceaseless (no double reroll rule)
- Fixed: All rerolls only target fails (optimal play - rerolling norms/crits can make results worse)
- Fixed: Severe rule now correctly blocks Punishing and Rending (Devastating and Piercing Crits still work)
- Moved Punishing from Advanced controls to main checkbox for easier access
- Removed EliteModerate2021 and EliteExtreme2021 (Kasrkin Elite points no longer relevant)
- Added Scenario Comparison Matrix: compare S1 vs S2 average damage and kill chances across all saves and wounds
- Added URL sharing: share calculator configurations via URL parameters
- Added S1&S2 Combo results table
- Fixed injury calculation (damage > half wounds)
